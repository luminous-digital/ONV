                    <p>
                        While nitrogen fertilizers offer a sustainable means of maximizing yields, farmer education is essential to ensure nitrogen fertilizer application is optimized for both production and environmental protection. OCI works with farmers around the world through various initiatives to achieve this goal.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We have dedicated resources to develop reliable fertilizers with superior spreading and fertigation properties. Our products are environmentally friendly and provide optimal crop nutrition due to their quality, resulting in lower nitrogen loss and increased crop yields.
                        <br><br>
                        Our fertilizers are produced to meet the highest physical quality standards to ensure optimal spreading efficiency, which in turn:

                        <li>minimizes soil nutrient loss,</li>

                        <li>to optimal fertilizer application</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Our granulated products, such as urea and CAN, are perfectly round and robust, making them easy to spread evenly for optimal results. Our aqueous fertilizers, primarily UAN, can be applied with fertigation and crop protection systems.
                        <br><br>
                        We have invested in research and technology to develop innovative products, such as Exacote, a range of coated fertilizer blends of urea, CAN and AS specifically formulated for a wide range of crops and nutrient requirements.
